The Cyclistic bike-share project is a data-driven case study aimed at understanding how different user groups interact with the bike-share system in Chicago. The focus is on analyzing Casual Riders vs. Annual Members to uncover trends that can help convert casual riders into long-term members.

🔹 Objective:
To identify key behavioral patterns between casual and annual members and develop a data-backed marketing strategy to increase memberships.

🔹 Key Findings:

Casual Riders take longer, leisurely rides, primarily for recreation and weekend outings.
Annual Members use bikes for weekday commuting, but their behavior shifts on weekends, mirroring casual users.
Memberships are more profitable than casual passes, making conversion a key business priority.
🔹 Approach:

Data Preparation: Extracted and cleaned Cyclistic's trip data.
Analysis Tools: Python (Jupyter Lab), Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib for visualization.
Insights & Recommendations: Designed strategies to encourage casual riders to commit to memberships through targeted promotions, commute-based incentives, and digital engagement.
This project showcases data analytics, business intelligence, and strategic decision-making, making it a valuable case study for real-world marketing applications. 🚴‍♂️💡
