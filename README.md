# Cyclistic-
The Cyclistic bike-share project analyzes user behavior in Chicago to convert casual riders into annual members. Casual users take long, leisurely rides, while members commute on weekdays but ride for leisure on weekends. Using Python and data visualization, insights drive marketing strategies to boost memberships and maximize revenue.
